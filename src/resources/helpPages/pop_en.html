<h1>POP</h1>
<h2>Pop data off stack</h2>
<br>
<p>The values ​​indicated by the SP stack pointer are loaded into the pair of registers. Data from the memory address pointed to by SP is loaded into the second register of the pair, and date at an address one greater than SP is loaded into the first register of the pair. If the PSW register pair is used, the data at address SP plus one is used to set the value of the flag register, at address SP the contents of the accumulator. Finally, the value in SP is increased by 2.</p>
<p>If POP PSW is used condition bits affected: Carry, Zero, Sign, Parity, Auxiliary Carry. Otherwise none bits affected.</p>
