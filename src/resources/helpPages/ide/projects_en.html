<h1>Projects</h1>
<br>
<p>Projects allow you to create programs from multiple files, use integration with the git version control system, as well as set up the simulator. They are the preferred way to create medium to larger programs.<p>
<h2>Creating project</h2>
<p>
To create a project, press the Project menu -> New Project. A window will appear asking you to enter the location of the project, its name and the initially set memory size of the simulator. After pressing the Ok button, the project will be created. The Git repository will also be initialized. If there are any errors in the project configuration, it will not be created.</p>
<h2>Project configuration</h2>
<p>
  The project is configured by editing the {project name}.config file. For example, if the project will be named exampleproject, the file will be called exampleproject.config. Initially, the file will not have many commands in it.
</p>
<p>
  Sample initial .config file for project first project.
</p>
  <div>
  <div>setMemory(256)</div>
  <div>startAt(0)</div>
  <div>setAt(src/main.asm,0)</div>
  </div>
<h2>.config file commands</h2>
<p>The .config file commands set various project-specific values. For example, these include variables such as the amount of simulator memory, the beginning of code execution or where individual files are placed in memory. The syntax of these commands is similar to calling a function. It looks like this: {command name}({values})</p>
<p>The above example shows three commands. The command in the first line setMemory(256) sets the simulator memory to 256 bytes. The next command is startAt(0) which sets the program execution from address 0. Next is setAt(src/main.asm,0) which causes the code from the main.asm file in the src directory to be placed in memory to address 0.</p>
<p>The setMemory(), setSP() and startAt() commands can be used only once, while the setAt() command can be used as many times as the number of files you want to include as part of the project.</p>
<h2>Search/Replace in project</h2>
<p>Projects have a special tab for searching and replacing strings of characters. To open it, select the Project -> Search/Replace. A new tab will appear named after your project. At the bottom of the tab there are two boxes labeled Search and Replace. In the find field, enter the string of characters you want to find, and in the replace field, the string of characters you want to replace it with. Below the fields are three buttons labeled Search, Replace Selected, and Replace All.</p>
<p>After pressing the search button, the project will be searched and the files that contain this string as well as the locations of this string in these files will be displayed in the central part of the tab. The found results can be marked by holding the SHIFT button and clicking on them with the left mouse button. After pressing the Replace button, selected strings of characters in the selected files will be replaced. The Replace All button replaces all occurrences of a string.</p>
