  <h1>Random Number Generator</h1>
  <p>The simulator features a pseudo-random number generator capable of generating numbers between 0 and 255. The generator engine is based on the Mersenne Twister. To set the maximum value that can be generated, place that number into output 6. The random number is located at input 6, and each subsequent read from this input triggers the generation of a new pseudo-random number.</p>
