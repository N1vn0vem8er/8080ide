    <h1>Graphical Screen</h1>
    <p>The graphical screen allows for the display of 256x256 pixel graphics in 256 colors. To open the screen, select Simulator -> Screen from the menu. The screen is operated using four microprocessor outputs. These outputs are as follows:</p>

    <table style="border-width: 1px;">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Output</th>
          <th>Action</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>02</td>
          <td>Set cursor x-position</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>03</td>
          <td>Set cursor y-position</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>04</td>
          <td>Apply specified color</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>05</td>
          <td>Select command</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Drawing on the screen involves selecting the cursor position using outputs 2 and 3, and then providing the color you wish to use on output 4. Colors are stored in RGB 3-3-2 format. The first three bits represent red, the next three bits represent blue, and the last two represent green. All available colors can be viewed by opening Help -> Screen Colors Palette. Normally, sending a color to output 4 will color the pixel where the cursor is currently set. The screen also features a series of commands that allow for easy coloring of entire shapes. Using most commands involves selecting the shape's coordinates, the shape is drawn the moment the color is provided.</p>
